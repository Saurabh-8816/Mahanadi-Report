# Mahanadi-Report


A **Power BI Dashboard** built to analyze **river water quality parameters** across monitoring stations in India.  
This project focuses on the **Mahanadi River system (Main River + Tributaries)**.

## 📈 Insights  

- Tributaries show significantly **higher coliform counts** compared to the main river.  
- Dissolved Oxygen is mostly within **acceptable limits (>5 mg/L)** as per CPCB guidelines.  
- Certain stations show elevated **BOD**, indicating localized pollution sources.
